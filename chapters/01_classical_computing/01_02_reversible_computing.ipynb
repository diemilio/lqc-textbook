    "In the [previous chapter](./01_01_digital_logic.ipynb), we introduced the concept of Boolean operators such as the binary operations **AND** and **OR**. A critical aspect of these elements is that they are **not** reversible. In other words, we cannot figure out the value of their inputs based solely on the value of the output. \n",

However, if the output is $0$, it is not possible to predict with certainty what the values of $a$ and $b$ are. This uncertainty is equivalent to a loss of information in our system.\n",

    "[Reversible computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing) was born from the idea that the loss of information in classical Boolean circuits is associated with power dissipation [[Landauer61]()]. In an effort to find more power-efficient ways to implement circuits, a model of reversible computation emerged [[Bennett73]()], and with it, a corresponding set of logical gate abstractions to perform these computations [[Toffoli80]()], [[Fredkin81]()].\n",
    "\n",
    "It was very quickly realized that a model of computation at the quantum-mechanical level can be developed following these same rules [[Feynman85]()], and expanded to include non-classical operations such as superposition and entanglement [[Deutsch85]()], [[Margolus89]()]. Therefore, understanding the basic principles of reversible computing is an important step towards a model of quantum computation."
