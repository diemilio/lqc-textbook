    "## 1. Binary Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "All modern computers and communication systems rely on the use of binary numbers. The fundamental unit of a binary number is the **bit**, which can take only two values: $0$ or $1$. But just like with decimal numbers, we can express larger binary values by concatenating bits together. For example, with 3 bits, we can express up to 8 different binary numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Binary | Decimal |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| $000$ | $0$ |\n",
    "| $001$ | $1$ |\n",
    "| $010$ | $2$ |\n",
    "| $011$ | $3$ |\n",
    "| $100$ | $4$ |\n",
    "| $101$ | $5$ |\n",
    "| $110$ | $6$ |\n",
    "| $111$ | $7$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $n$ bits allow us to express up to $2^n$ different values. So an $n$-bit number $b$ is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b = b_{n-1} ... b_1 b_0 ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each of the bits $b_i$ can take the value $0$ or $1$. This is often denoted as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$b \\in \\{0,1\\}^n .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This simply means that $b$ can take any of the possible values of combining $n$ of these symbols. For example, for $n = 3$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b \\in \\{ 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111 \\}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "just like we had in the table above. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the notation used above for $b$, the bit most to the left, $b_0$, is known as the least significant bit (LSB); on the other hand, the bit most to the right, $b_{n-1}$, is known as the most significant bit (MSB).\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a binary number $b$ to a decimal integer $x$, we simply take each of the individual bits, and multiply them by 2 exponentiated to the bit's significance, and then sum them up:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x =  2^{n-1} b_{n-1} + ... + 2^{1} b_{1} + 2^{0} b_{0}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which we can write more compactly as using big-sum notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = \\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} 2^{i} b_i .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to convert the binary value $1011$ to decimal we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "x &=  2^{3} b_{3} + 2^{2} b_{2} + 2^{1} b_{1} + 2^{0} b_{0}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this manually is a tedious process. Luckily we can use Python to do this conversion for us. In Python we can represent binary numbers by using the prefix `0b`. These values still get treated like other integers, so if we, for example, print them, the output displays the corresponding decimal value:"
