    "## 1. Binary Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "All modern computers and communication systems rely on the use of binary numbers. The fundamental unit of a binary number is the **bit**, which can take only two values: $0$ or $1$, but just like with decimal numbers, we can express larger binary values by concatenating bits together. For example, with 3 bits, we can express up to 8 different binary numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Binary | Decimal |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 000 | 0 |\n",
    "| 001 | 1 |\n",
    "| 010 | 2 |\n",
    "| 011 | 3 |\n",
    "| 100 | 4 |\n",
    "| 101 | 5 |\n",
    "| 110 | 6 |\n",
    "| 111 | 7 |\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $n$ bits allow us to express up to $2^n$ different values. So, an $n$-bit binary number $b$ can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b = b_{n-1} ... b_1 b_0 ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each bit $b_i$ can take the value $0$ or $1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notation, the bit most to the left, $b_0$, is known as the least significant bit (LSB). The bit most to the right, $b_{n-1}$, is known as the most significant bit (MSB).\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a binary number $b$ to a decimal integer $x$, we simply take each of the individual bits, and multiply them by 2 exponentiated to the bit's significance, and then sum them up:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x =  2^{n-1} b_{n-1} + ... + 2^{1} b_{1} + 2^{0} b_{0}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which we can write more compactly as using big-sum notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = \\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} 2^{i} b_i .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to convert, for example, the binary value $1101$ to decimal, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "x &=  2^{3} b_{3} + 2^{2} b_{2} + 2^{1} b_{1} + 2^{0} b_{0}\n",

    "\\\\\n",
    "x &=  13\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this manually is a tedious process. Luckily we can use Python to do this conversion for us. In Python we can represent binary numbers by using the prefix `0b`. These values still get treated like other integers, so if we, for example, print them, the output displays the corresponding decimal value:"
