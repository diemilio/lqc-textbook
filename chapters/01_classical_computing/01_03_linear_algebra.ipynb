    "An extremely attractive feature of reversible logic is that it maps very naturally to the use of vectors to represent boolean values (inputs/outputs), and matrices to express operations (gates and circuits). With very little extra work, reversible circuits can be turned into simple linear algebra relations, where multiplying an input vector by a circuit matrix gives us the corresponding output."

It is also worth noting that we have added an arrow on top of $0$ and $1$ to distinguish the vectors themselves from the values they can take inside the brackets.\n",

Similarly, a Boolean $1$ would represent the light bulb being on, which happens when the switch if flipped down ($0$ in the top space of the vector, $1$ at the bottom):\n",

You see, in this textbook I want to prioritize accessibility over formalism in the first few chapters, but always making sure we gradually introduce the necessary concepts.
