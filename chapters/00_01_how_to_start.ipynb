    "Before installing any of the necessary Python packages, it is highly recommended to use what is known as an [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) manager. This allows us to have a separate environment where we can specify the version of Python we want to use and the dependencies (packages) we needed for our project. Two popular options for Python environments are [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/); here we will use the latter. \n",
