    "Before installing any of the necessary Python packages, it is highly recommended to use what is known as an [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) manager. This allows us to have a separate environment where we can specify the version of Python we want to use and the dependencies (packages) we needed for our project. Two popular options for Python environments are [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). Here we will use the latter. \n",

    "    \n",
    "To get `conda` up and running we need to install [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html), which can be done by downloading the installer corresponding to your operating system.\n",

    " - macOS users: it is easier to download and install the `pkg` version over the `bash` version since it comes with a visual user interface.\n",
