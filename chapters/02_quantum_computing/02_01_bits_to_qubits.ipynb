    "Quantum computers, or more precisely, quantum processing units (QPUs), are devices that exploit quantum-mechanical effects to perform certain computations at a much faster rate than conventional (classical) computers. In order to understand how these devices work, we must familiarize ourselves with the quantum phenomena that enables this added computational advantage. In particular, we must understand the concepts of [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition), [entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) and [quantum interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference).\n",

    "From a computational standpoint, qubits are a generalization of classical bits and are the fundamental unit in quantum computing. There are many different ways in which we can introduce the concept of a qubit. Here, we will follow a relatively intuitive approach by looking at how electrons behave under the influence of an external magnetic field.\n",

    "### 1.1 The Spin of an Electron\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental properties of electrons is that they have an intrinsic angular momentum. This property is commonly known as spin, even though particles are not really spinning. The spin of an electron can be deduced experimentally by using what is known as a [Stern-Gerlach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment) apparatus. This device consists of two magnet poles shaped in a way such that the magnetic field between them is **non-uniform**, having a higher intensity at the top where the magnet is sharper: \n",

    "<img src=\"images/02_01_01_stern-gerlach_field.png\" align = \"center\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if an object with a magnetic moment, like a tiny bar magnet, is sent into this device along the $y$ direction, it will experience a force in the vertical $z$ direction that will cause it to deflect upwards or downwards. A bar magnet with its north pole pointing up will deflect upwards. On the other hand, a bar magnet with its north pole pointing down will deflect downwards:\n",

    "<img src=\"images/02_01_02_stern-gerlach_n-s_magnets.png\" align = \"center\" width=\"700\"/>\n",

    "If designed correctly, a bar magnet with its north pointing in the $\\texttt{+}x$ (or $\\texttt{-}x$ direction) should experience an equal force from the top and bottom magnet poles, and therefore should travel in a straight path: \n",
    "<img src=\"images/02_01_03_stern-gerlach_straight_magnet.png\" align = \"center\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the force experienced by the bar magnet depends on the angle $\\theta$ between its magnetic moment (i.e., where its north pole points to) and the direction of the external magnetic field. Therefore, if we were to perform this experiment for bar magnets with varying angles in the magnetic moment, the z-axis landing location on the back screen will vary between where the landing position of the up-pointing and down-pointing magnets, and will be dependent on the angle $\\theta$.\n",

    "Now, because electrons are charge particles, their intrinsic angular momentum (spin) expresses itself as a magnetic moment just as we have for a tiny bar magnet. So, if we were to replace the magnets with electrons in the experiment above[$^*$](#footnote1), the expectation is that we should see the exact same behavior of electrons being deflected in the $z$ direction as a function of the angle between the electron's magnetic moment and the direction of the external magnetic field.\n",

We can perfectly rotate the device so the field is now in the $x$ direction. And, if we now send electrons with their spin along the $\\texttt{+}x$ (or $\\texttt{-}x$) axis, we will see them deflect to the right (or to the left) accordingly, which shows that there is indeed a way to experimentally tell these are two different states:\n",

    "\n",
    "A key observation from the probabilistic model we proposed above is that, since the components $P_{\\texttt{+}z}$ and $P_{\\texttt{-}z}$ of the vector $\\vec{s}$ are probabilities (which are always numbers between $0$ and $1$ and must add up to $1$), there is simply no way we can recover the original vector that describes $\\vec{s}_{\\texttt{+}z}$ by using linear combinations of other probability vectors. This is because the second entry in $\\vec{s}_{\\texttt{+}z}$ is a $0$, so there are no two positive numbers that can add up to it (unless they are both $0$). What this implies is that, for our maths to work, we need to also allow **negative** entries in our vectors. However, since these vectors still need to describe probabilistic experimental results and probabilities cannot be negative, we need a new rule that tells us how to relate these new vector elements to probabilities. Well, a simple recipe to turn negative numbers into positive numbers is to square them, so we could propose to have the elements of our vectors to be numbers that when squared turn into the probabilities we see in experimental results!
