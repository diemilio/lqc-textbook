    "<a name=\"footnote1\"></a><span style=\"font-size: smaller;\">$^*$Note that here we are just abstractly superimposing the complex plane with the physical $xy$-plane to assign a complex number to the corresponding statevector associated with the spin in some given direction on this plane. We are **not** saying that this complex number is related to the physical length of the spin vector, or directly multiplying the full statevector. The relation between this complex value and the state is clarified in the section discussing the Bloch sphere. ([go back](#back1))"
