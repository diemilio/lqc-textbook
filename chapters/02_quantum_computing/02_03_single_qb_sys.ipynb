    "In the introductory chapter to [quantum bits and circuits](https://learnquantum.io/chapters/02_quantum_computing/02_01_bits_to_qubits.html), we presented the model of a qubit inspired by the probabilistic behavior of the spin of an electron. However, we only described how the electron behaves when its spin was pointing in the $\\texttt{+}z, \\texttt{-}z, \\texttt{+}x, \\texttt{-}x$ directions (described by states $|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle, |+\\rangle, |-\\rangle$, respectively). \n",

    "But what if the spin is pointing along some arbitrary angle with respect to the $\\texttt{+}z$ direction? We did mention that the probability of measuring spin-up or spin-down depends on this angle, but did not give a quantitative rule for how electrons behave. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will not only expand on this idea, but will generalize the state of the spin of an electron pointing in any direction, which represents the most general way to express the state of a qubit. We will then discuss the different operations we can apply to a qubit to transform it from one arbitrary state to another, and lastly talk about the Bloch Sphere, which is a graphical representation of the mathematical description of the qubit's state."

    "This generalization of the qubit, where the probability amplitudes are given by the $\\cos$ and $\\sin$ squared of the angle $\\theta/2$, works well to describe the results of the Stern-Gerlach experiment; however, there is a bit of an issue. In this particular case, we are only concerned about the direction of the spin on the $xz$-plane because we are shooting the electrons along the $y$ direction. But how do we describe the spin of the electron if it is aligned with, let's say, the $\\texttt{+}y$ axis? Well, experiments show that, if we were to measure the spin of such an electron along the $z$ axis, we will still see the electron deflecting up or down with $50\\%$ probability. As a matter of fact, this is true no matter which orientation (given by the angle $\\varphi$) the electron has in the $xy$ plane:\n",
