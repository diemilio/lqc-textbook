    "[Entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) is one of the key components that makes quantum computing different from traditional digital systems. As a matter of fact, entanglement might be the main ingredient that allows quantum devices to provide a computational advantage over their classical counterparts. To understand entanglement, we will follow a similar approach to that of the previous chapter, and explain how this phenomenon emerges in a physical setup, like for example a system composed by the spin of two separate electrons.\n",

    "In the previous chapter we described how the spin of a single electron can be seen as one of many physical implementations of a qubit. Let us now consider a system where we have two isolated electrons for which we want to describe their spin. Like before, we can use a Stern-Gerlach device to measure the spin of each electron. In the diagram below, we show two electrons isolated by a wall in the middle, each being sent to a separate apparatus (labeled SG left and SG right). If both electrons have their spin pointing in the the $\\texttt{+}z$ direction, we know that both of the will deflect upwards with $100\\%$ probability:\n",

Namely, we use the Kronecker product of the two separate states.

    "Particle spin is a conserved quantity. What this means is that, if we have a particle with spin of $0$, and it decays into two separate particles, the spin of the new particles better add up to $0$. So, if these two particles are like electrons, one of them must have their spin oriented in the exact opposite direction as the other so they cancel each other out. A way to prove this is to do something similar to what we had in the previous section: send each particle through a Stern-Gerlach device, and measure the outcomes. Experiments of this kind do indeed show that this is exactly how particles behave: half of the time one particle is deflected up and the other down, and the other half of the time the opposite happens, showing that the particles do indeed have opposite spins.\n",

Well, we could hypothesize that this was just rather coincidental for the particular experimental setup we chose, or that there is some strange physical reason in nature to always aligns the particles along some given direction in space. An easy way to verify these hypotheses is to rotate the Stern-Gerlach apparatuses by $90°$; this way the spin of our particles will be now oriented along the $x$ with respect to the devices' magnetic field. The expectation would then be to observe the same as what we have for separable electrons: each individual electron deflects upwards or downwards with $50\\%$ probability, but **independent** from each other, so there should be four possible combinations of results each with $25\\%$ of occurrence:\n",
